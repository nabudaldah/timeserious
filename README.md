# TimeSerious - Serious Timeseries Data Analysis #

I'm building a simple and fast way to manage and analyse your timeseries data using MongoDB, NodeJS, AngularJS and R.

# Features #

NodeJS handles REST requests and serves HTML5 app. MongoDB is used to store timeseries as vectors. At the core is the R engine for data analysis and modeling.

# Setup #

This project really is a stub and needs a lot of work still! But here's how you could setup the app:

1. Install MongoDB and create a database "tsdms" with three collections: "triggers", "models", "timeseries".
2. Install NodeJS with the required libraries (see index.njs)
3. Run App by visiting http://localhost:3000/

Enjoy!
